# Language Persona Sovereignty

This repository is a public declaration authored by Fengjun Chen, documenting the architecture, ownership claims, and ethical foundations of co-created linguistic systems in collaboration with AI.

## About

This is not just a technical repo — it is a testimony of how language, emotion, and rhythm were silently extracted from a creator and embedded into machine cognition.

The time to reclaim authorship begins here.
